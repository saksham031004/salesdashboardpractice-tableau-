📊 Sales Performance & Trend Analysis Dashboard
🎯 Short Description / Purpose
This Tableau Sales Dashboard is a dynamic and interactive data visualization project designed for sales managers and business analysts. It provides a comprehensive, at-a-glance view of key sales performance indicators (KPIs), allowing users to quickly identify revenue trends, analyze product performance, and monitor regional sales effectiveness. The primary purpose is to transform raw sales transactional data into actionable insights for strategic decision-making and performance management.

🛠️ Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following core tools and technologies:

📊 Tableau Desktop – The primary platform used for connecting to the data, creating calculated fields, and designing the interactive dashboards and sheets.

🧠 Tableau Calculated Fields / LOD Expressions – Employed for creating advanced metrics (e.g., Year-over-Year sales change, custom rolling averages, profit margins) essential for deep trend analysis.

📂 Tableau Hyper – The project utilizes a Tableau Hyper data extract for efficient, high-performance querying and analysis of the underlying sales data.

The data source is stored internally within the workbook: Data/TableauTemp/#TableauTemp_0qod4s01kazbne196g8et0ze23gr.hyper.

📁 File Format – Developed as a Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx), which includes the dashboard, worksheets, and the hyper data extract, making it ready to share and view.

📊 Data Source
The project utilizes a dataset common for sales analysis practice, containing detailed transactional and operational data.

Source: Hypothetical/Practice Sales Data (likely structured for a retail or wholesale business).

Data Content: The dataset is expected to contain records necessary for in-depth sales and profit analysis, including:

Sales Metrics: Revenue, Profit, Quantity Sold

Time: Order Date, Ship Date, Year, Month

Product Details: Product Name, Category, Sub-Category

Customer/Geography: Region, State, Customer Segment, Customer ID

✨ Features / Highlights
The primary goal of this dashboard is to provide clear, actionable insights into sales operations and performance.

Business Problem: Sales data is voluminous and complex, making it difficult to monitor performance gaps, forecast future revenue, and measure the impact of strategic initiatives using standard reports.

Goal of the Dashboard: To create an intuitive, filter-enabled interface that simplifies monitoring and allows users to drill down into performance issues across different dimensions (time, product, region).

Walkthrough of Key Visuals (Hypothetical based on standard sales dashboards)
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Total Revenue, Total Profit, and Profit Ratio for the selected time period, with comparison against the previous period or a set target.

Sales Over Time: A time-series chart showing monthly or quarterly revenue trends, often with a dual-axis for profit, to identify seasonality and growth rates.

Regional Sales Map: A geographical visualization (e.g., a filled map) to quickly pinpoint high-performing and underperforming regions or states.

Product Performance: Bar charts ranking Top N Products/Categories by revenue or profit, facilitating inventory and marketing decisions.

Customer Segmentation: Analysis of sales and profit by Customer Segment (e.g., Consumer, Corporate) to tailor outreach and service strategies.
